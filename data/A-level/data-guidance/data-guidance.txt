Footnotes:

1. Disadvantage status is as reported at the end of key stage 4. Analysis involving disadvantage status includes students at state-funded schools and colleges only.
2. Figures for the total number of students may not match the sum of females and males, as not all institutions recorded the gender for every student.
3. EHC plans and statements of SEN are legal documents which detail the needs of the individual student, and the assistance they are to receive.
