Footnotes:

1. East Hertfordshire district boundary was changed in 2014. The local authority district code was changed from E07000097 to E07000242 to reflect this.
2. Welwyn Hatfield district boundary was changed in 2013. The local authority district code was changed from E07000104 to E07000241 to reflect this.
3. Northumberland district boundary was changed in 2014. The local authority district code was changed from E06000048 to E06000057 to reflect this.
4. : = When data is unavailable for other reasons
5. In 2020 and 2021, all GCSEs in England have been reformed and use the new 9 to 1 grading system (rather than A*-G). Year on year comparisons will be limited until these qualifications are consistently included from 2020 onwards. However, results for 2020 and 2021 are not comparable with earlier years due to the cancellation of exams (due to COVID-19) and the changes to the way GCSE grades were awarded and results for 2022 are not comparable with previous years due to the changes relating to grading assessments.
6. All state-funded schools include local authority maintained mainstream schools, academies, free schools, city technology colleges, further education colleges with provision for 14 to 16 year-olds and state-funded special schools. They exclude independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision. Alternative provision includes academy and free school alternative provision. 
7. Stevenage district boundary was changed in 2014. The local authority district code was changed from E07000101 to E07000243 to reflect this.
8. z = When an observation is not applicable
9. Gateshead district boundary was changed in 2014. The local authority district code was changed from E08000020 to E08000037 to reflect this.
10. c = a cell that has been suppressed due to low number of pupils. Suppression was applied where deemed necessary for all data up to 2018/19. For 2019/20, DfE suppression policy changed. For 2020 and 2021 results where a geographical area contains only one school (for example Isles of Scilly) the data for that area has been suppressed. This is in line with the announcement that school level data would not be published using either summer 2020 or summer 2021 exam grades awarded. Data is not being supressed in 2022 at local authority or national level.
11. The residency of 897 pupils living in England in 2021/22 is unknown due to missing or invalid postcode information. Pupils not resident in England and pupils with missing or invalid postcode information are excluded from the figures in presented.
12. Some zero percentages may represent small numbers due to rounding.
13. St Albans district boundary was changed in 2013. The local authority district code was changed from E07000100 to E07000240 to reflect this.
14. Northamptonshire district boundary was changed in 2021. The local authority district code was changed from E10000021 to E06000061 (North Northamptonshire) and E06000062 (West Northamptonshire).
15. A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils in the group make on average approximately a grade more progress than the national average; a score of -0.5 means they make on average approximately half a grade less progress than average. Progress 8 scores should be interpreted alongside the associated confidence intervals. If the lower bound of the confidence interval is greater than zero, it can be interpreted as meaning that the group achieves greater than average progress compared to pupils in mainstream schools nationally and that this is statistically significant. If the upper bound is negative, this means that the group achieves lower than average progress compared to pupils in mainstream schools nationally and that this is statistically significant.
